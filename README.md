**ColourSegmentation** is a library for chromatic segmentation from a colour palette, written in pure Python.

When you have to segment an image into the colours that appear in the scene, or you want to determine the dominant colour among a palette of colours, you need sophisticated methods that can handle the uncertainty of colour selection. Colour Segmentation offers the implementation of four colour palettes and colour classification using fuzzy logic.
